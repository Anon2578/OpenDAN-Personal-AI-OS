OpenDAN is an open source Personal AI OS , which consolidates various AI modules in one place for your personal use.

## **Project Introduction**

The goal of OpenDAN (Open and Do Anything Now with AI) is to create a Personal AI OS and provide a runtime environment for various Al modules as well as protocols for interoperability between them. With OpenDAN, users can securely collaborate with various AI modules using their private data to create powerful personal AI agents, such as butler, lawyer, doctor, teacher, assisstant, girl or boy friends.

This project is still in its very early stages, and there may be significant changes in the future.

## **Core Features of OpenDAN**

To achieve the goal of OpenDAN, we provide the following key features:

1. **Hardware-specific optimization**: Optimize for specific hardware to enable smooth local running of most open-source AI applications.
2. **Open AI App Marketplace**: Offer a solution for one-click installation and use of various AI applications, helping users easily access and manage AI apps.
3. **Open AI Model Solution**: Provide a unified entry point for model search, download, and access control, making it convenient for users to find and use models suitable for their needs.
4. **Strict Privacy Protection and Management**: Strictly manage personal data, ranging from family albums to chat records and social media records, and provide a unified access control interface for AI applications.
5. **Integrated Tools**: Offer tools for users to train their own voice models, Lora models, knowledge models, etc., using personal data.
6. **AI Butler Assistant**: Driven by a large language model, the AI assistant completes tasks through natural language interaction.
7. **Development Framework**: Provide a development framework for customizing AI assistants for specific purposes, making it easy for developers to create unique AI applications for users.
